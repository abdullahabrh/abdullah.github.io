        <li>Compared linear probability, logit, and probit models when predicting high hotel ratings and firm-level management quality; assessed predicted probabilities and marginal effects.</li>
        <li>Conducted hypothesis testing and confidence-interval analysis, including t-tests, significance thresholds, and p-value interpretation.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="entry-title">TRADING &amp; PORTFOLIO THEORY — RISK, RETURN, OPTIMAL PORTFOLIOS &amp; ALPHA</div>
    <div class="entry-sub">Trading &amp; Portfolio Theory · CEU · Excel · Solver · Real-time Trading</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed financial assets and market data using Excel, applying core portfolio-theory concepts including mean–variance optimization, diversification, and the risk–return trade-off.</li>
        <li>Constructed monthly return series for SPY (equities), BND (bonds), and GLD (gold); computed excess returns using the 3-month T-bill rate; derived volatilities, covariances, correlations, and Sharpe ratios.</li>
        <li>Built and solved a full mean–variance optimal portfolio using Excel Solver, identified the tangency portfolio, traced the Capital Allocation Line (CAL), and compared efficient-frontier positions across investor risk profiles.</li>
        <li>Converted optimal portfolio weights into ETF holdings for a hypothetical USD 100,000 allocation, demonstrating practical money-management and risk-budgeting skills.</li>
        <li>Evaluated equilibrium asset-pricing models:
            <ul>
                <li>Single-index model and the CAPM (beta estimation, SML, expected return).</li>
                <li>Fama–French multi-factor models and factor-based performance attribution.</li>
